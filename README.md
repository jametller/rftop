# rftop
This project aims to be a console based RF broad-band scanner for RTL-SDR deveices. It is implemented in Python 3 and is based in the use of rtl_power, so these are the main requirements to run this script.

The main goal is having a top (linux process monitoring tool) like interface implemented using curses which continuously updates information of certain frequencies detected within a range.
